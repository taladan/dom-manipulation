# DOM Manipulation

This is an exercise in DOM manipulation with JS and CSS.

The inital exercise was to create a table programatically on a website with JS after setting up a simple HTML document with a single div in it. It has since grown past that point. I invite you to check out the projects and inspect their code, provide feedback/corrections as you like!
