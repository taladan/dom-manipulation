  # Mouse trail

    In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with
    lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring ways to use
    the language.

    One of these was the mouse trail—a series of elements that would follow the
    mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.

    In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely
    positioned <div> elements with a fixed size and background color (refer to the
    code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an example). Create a bunch of such
    elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake of the mouse
    pointer.

    There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as
    simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is to keep a
    fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the next one to
    the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs.
    
    The following snippet was provided by the exercise:

    ```
    <style>
      .trail { /* className for the trail elements */
        position: absolute;
        height: 6px; width: 6px;
        border-radius: 3px;
        background: teal;
      }
      body {
        height: 300px;
      }
    </style>

    <script>
      // Your code here.
    </script>
    ```
-->
    <div id="container"></div>
  </body>
</html>
